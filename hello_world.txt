Bumps in my apartment wall
Shadows of a previous tenant
markings on the floor
scars of another family

my own sprawling mess, comforting in its chaos
lighters with no butane, coffee cups filled with stained towels
maintaining partnership with particle board decor and hand-me-down furniture
We're happy here, all things considered. Each evening bleeds intimately into morning light
